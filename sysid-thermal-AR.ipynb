Due to the complexity of the problem, it will turn out not to be feasible to naively apply Bayesian techniques to identify the parameters; we will have to make use of an approximate method. We will therefore experiment with two (families of) approximate techniques, Variational Bayes and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to see which is best suited to our needs. Having chosen an approach, we will perform various experiments. For this, we will use our models to generate test data, and subsequently investigate the quality of parameter estimates.

The temperatures will evolve due to a number of different factors; we will only consider the influence of conduction, convection, radiation, and the user controlled input heat. \n",

    "Unfortunately, the physical setup was not completed in time for us to experiment with \"real\" data. Instead, we will have to make do with artificial data, i.e. data that we have generated ourselves. So that we may experiment with parameters that are somewhat realistic, we will now estimate their typical sizes. Furthermore, we will estimate the magnitude and typical time scales of the heat exchange mechanisms. Such time scale are good to know, as they can help us design experiments that generate data on which inference is more effective. A summary of the typical magnitudes of our parameters can be found in the table below (it seems the large number of units messed up the formatting of the table🙃); for the derivation I refer to Section 2.2 of my report:\n",

Intuitively, we can only learn about the value of parameters when these parameters actually influence the observations. For instance, if we start with all temperatures being equal, we will not be able to learn anything about the conduction coefficients, because conduction will not play an important role in the evolution of the temperatures. Therefore, it seems like it would be optimal to observe over the typical time scale over which parameters are relevant. That makes this problem quite interesting, since we are trying to identify parameters whose influence plays out on time scales that differ by an order of magnitude. Consequently, we cannot choose an observation horizon that is optimal for all the parameters simultaneously. On the other hand, if all parameters were relevant on similar time scales, we might encounter unidentifiability, i.e. that the various origins of the influences on the observations cannot be distinguished.\n",

We take an entire family of such simple distributions, and then try to find the one that is closest to our true distribution in an iterative manner. It is possible to break the computations down into simple update steps, which are performed based on a factor graph which describes the relations between our variables: this makes VB suitable for online estimation on limited hardware.

For a brief background on MCMC, MH, and HMC, I refer to Section 3.2 of my report. [Betancourt (2017)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434) provides some deeper intuition about HMC.\n",

The most basic method is to use a random walk: this is the original Metropolis algorithm [Metropolis (1953)](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1699114). We can associate a distribution $g(\\hat{\\vec{z}}_{n + 1} \\given \\vec{z}_n)$ with this. \n",

It would not make sense for any of these to be negative, since this would lead to heat flowing from cold sources into hot sinks, in contravention of the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics#Second_law) Carter (2000), Ch. 6. Hence, we make use of Gamma priors. Finally, we treat the standard deviation of the measurement noise as an unknown quantity. This might help by absorbing any other sources of (process) noise. It would again be sensible to use a positively supported prior like the Gamma distribution for this. We pose reasonably broad priors (this does not seem to be very important in this case: it seems like there is a lot of learning going on)."

    "With Turing.jl and DifferentialEquations.jl, defining the probabilistic model is very easy. First, we pose the priors. With MCMC, we do not have to worry about conjugate priors. In general, as long as the support of the prior is infinite, semi-infinite, or an interval, as is the case for most nice continuous random variables, Turing.jl is able to work (under the hood, it automatically performs a transformation to make the support infinite, which is required for HMC (derived) methods). We subsequently take in all of the known parameters. Next, we determine how, given a certain sample of unknown parameters, the temperatures would evolve. Finally, we give the corresponding distribution of each observation, in this case a normal distribution with mean equal to the temperature predicted based on the current sample and fixed variance $\\sigma^2$. The likelihood (for that sample of unknown parameters) will then be the product of all these distributions, i.e. the joint distribution (since the noise of each measurement is independent)."

    "Finally, we can perform the sampling. We make use of the [No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) sampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo#No_U-Turn_Sampler) in [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl), which can be seen as building on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). One advantage of this sampler is that we only have to choose the acceptance rate: it will automatically tune a bunch of internal parameters (e.g. step size) to achieve this acceptance rate. A popular acceptance rate is 0.65, since Beskos et al. in their 2010 paper [\"Optimal Tuning of the Hybrid Monte-Carlo Algorithm\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4460v1) showed that this is asymptotically the optimal choice in the sense of balancing the cost of proposal generation with the typical number of required proposals per sample. Finally, we take 2500 samples per chain, for which Turing automatically chooses a burn-in period of 1000 samples. To check whether we have reached equilibrium after the burn-in period, we sample three independent Markov chains: if the resulting empirical posteriors roughly correspond, we can be reasonably confident that we had reached equilibrium before taking the \"real\" samples."

    "Indeed, the empirical posteriors of the unknown parameters look good: they peak close to the true values, and are rather narrow (width of $~10^{-1}$ for convection, $~10^{-3}$ for conduction). One should bear in mind that the observations are random due to the noise, so small deviations of the MAP from the true value do not necessarily indicate something has gone wrong. If we ran the tests again, we would see the MAPs shift slightly. \n",

    "On the other hand, the approximate posterior of the standard deviation of the measurement noise looks very far from the true value. This does appear to suggest a systematic problem with the inference. I believe this is due to the fact that our discretisation effectively introduces process noise. This process noise is indistinguishable from measurement noise, and simply gets added on top. However, this does not have to be a problem: we are not really interested in learning the measurement noise, and the fact that it can absorb process noise is a nice property."

    "The previous experiment gives a promising result: it seems like the parameters identified using a more simple model can accurately reproduce the true physics. One issue, however, is that the perceived accuracy may be due to overfitting. In this section, we would like to put the parameter estimates combined with the simple lumped-element model to the test. We could do this in multiple ways:\n",
    "1) We could change some of the known parameters;\n",
    "2) We could simulate further time, i.e. we identify based on say the first $500~\\second$, and compare the predicted and true trajectories over the subsequent $500~\\second$;\n",
    "3) We could identify on a subset of the data, say the first $100~\\second$, and compare the predicted and true trajectories on the remaining data;\n",
    "4) We could change the input heats and initial temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method does not seem practically applicable: in the true setup, these types constants cannot be changed without disassembly, which should probably be followed by more calibration, anyway. In our case, the second method does not sound like it would be very useful, either: the state of our setup naturally moves towards an equilibrium over time, and therefore, the errors would become smaller over time. This means that we would not be able properly assess how good the state prediction is. To mitigate this issue, we could make use of the third approach. Finally, changing the input heats and initial temperatures seems like something that would be relevant in practice, and so the fourth method seems reasonable. We have decided to use the latter of these two viable methods, since it would seem to more drastically change the observed data."

Next, we have plotted the corresponding true trajectories, with the sampled trajectories overlaid. The top right diagram shows the residuals, i.e. the difference between each sampled trajectory and the true trajectory. For small $t$, the residuals grow: this is due to the fact that the initial temperatures are treated as known constants. Eventually, the residuals tend to stabilise, with the difference remaining less than about $10^{-2}~\\kelvin$, which is good considering the typical temperatures are $10^2~\\kelvin$ and the measurement accuracy is also about $10^{-2}~\\kelvin$. The histograms on the bottom row show histograms of the \\gls{mse} for each temperature. Each data point represents the MSE over an entire sampled trajectory.

    "### Sliced Blocks Model\n",
    "In our [exploration of MCMC](Explore_MCMC.ipynb), as well as the previous examples, we saw that MCMC works well when we use the simple lumped-element model (with blocks with internally constant temperature) for both the physical and the probabilistic model. To derive our governing equations, we implicitly assumed that conduction within blocks occurs at a much higher rate than any other heat transfer process, so that each block has a single temperature throughout. This is only realistic if the internal conduction is much faster than the conduction between blocks. In the following section, we will first discuss how to augment the physical model to allow for temperature gradients within blocks. We will then perform inference on data generated in this way, using two different probabilistic models: the more simple lumped-element model we have used up to now, and the sliced blocks model we propose in this section.\n",
    "#### Physical Model\n",
    "One way we can deal with this is by chopping each block up into (equally sized) slices, which exchange heat between each other. We assume that slices within a block conduct in a known way. This seems sensible because internal conduction coefficients of metals are well-known physical constants (though they may depend on temperature, I think it reasonable to neglect this in the termpature ranges we are dealing with). We only observe the temperature of the central slice of each block, which is also where the external heat gets put into the system (This probably is not a very sensible thing to do in real life...), reusing the input heats from above. Finally, we again neglect the influence of radiation."

    "Due to the complexity of the probabilistic model, inference is very slow: e.g. for each sample from the Markov chain, the trajectories (including the latent ones) have to be numerically computed. For that reason, I have decided to only take 1000 samples instead of 2500. On top of that, I only sample from a single Markov chain, whereas in the other examples I used three independent chains. Multiple chains are mostly useful for diagnostic purposes, since by looking at whether the empirical posteriors are roughly equal one can determine whether equilibrium has been reached in the burn-in stage. Moreover, more chains also means more samples (although it would be more efficient to sample from a single chain, since then you only have to throw away a single set of burn-in samples). We simply trust that equilibrium has been reached, and make do with fewer samples."

    "Indeed, the MAP estimates for the parameters is very close to the true values, although the variance is somewhat larger than when we generated data with the lumped-element model. Using the sliced blocks model for the identification has significantly reduced the estimate for the standard deviation of the measurement noise, but it is still quite large. It therefore might be interesting to investigate what the sources of this are: by dealing with these it could be possible to improve the identification of the parameters of interest. "
